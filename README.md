# Random-Tester
>Sample Tester for Competitive Programming competitions.
> X.cpp and Y.cpp are the codes to be tested against.
> for example:
>  X.cpp - O(n^2) Correct solution
>  Y.cpp - O(n*lg(n)) Wrong/ToBeTested solution
>  run Tester, find a test case where Y fails. ez

* Save codes in X and Y 
* Run X.cpp and Y.cpp, then Tester.cpp
* Tester.cpp feeds input to a.in
* X.exe and Y.exe are executed and Outputs saved to x.out and y.out
* Tester.cpp reads outputs and compares
* Prints "OK" for same outputs | Prints "Wrong" if otherwise and stops

### When Tester fails:
	
* 1) close exe file 
* 2) open a.in 
	     which will consist of the test case where outputs differ
* 3) enjoy finding a bug 
* 4) ez gg wp
